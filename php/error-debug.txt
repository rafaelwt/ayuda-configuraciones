For VSCode as the OP has asked and xdebug 3.x.x, the configuration should be -

xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.start_upon_error=yes
xdebug.client_host=[IP address] <<<< NOTE
xdebug.discover_client_host=true
xdebug.client_port=9000
Note: xdebug.client_host should have the host IP address for vscode (192.168...) and not host.docker.internal which does not seem to work for vscode.

Note 2: There is no need to open any port (9000 in the config above) for this purpose. This could be because docker connects back to host at port 9000 and not vice versa!
