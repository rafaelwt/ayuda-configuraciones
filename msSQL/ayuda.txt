After you get the error, run

EXEC sp_who2
Look for the database in the list. It's possible that a connection was not terminated. If you find any connections to the database, run

KILL <SPID>
where <SPID> is the SPID for the sessions that are connected to the database.

Try your script after all connections to the database are removed.

Unfortunately, I don't have a reason why you're seeing the problem, but here is a link that shows that the problem has occurred elsewhere.
