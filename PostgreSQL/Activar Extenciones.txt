# Centos OS Activar crosstab

For the postgrersql10

I have solved it with

yum install postgresql10-contrib
Don't forget to activate extensions in postgresql.conf

shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
pg_stat_statements.track = all
then of course restart

systemctl restart postgresql-10.service 
all of the needed extensions you can find here

/usr/pgsql-10/share/extension/
